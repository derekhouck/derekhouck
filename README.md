## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior full-stack software engineer with 6+ years of experience working on applications with Ruby on Rails backends and React frontends. I specialize in test-driven development. I build reliable and well-tested RESTful and GraphQL APIs.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Back in the 90â€™s, I ran a [Mortal Kombat fan site](https://web.archive.org/web/19990210064637/http://www.geocities.com:80/TimesSquare/Arcade/2124/main.html) where people could submit their custom fighters into an online tournament voted on by the siteâ€™s visitors. (All done using handwritten HTML, CSS, and Perl scripts.)
